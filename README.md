# mysql-biochar-sales-analysis

# Biochar Database Project

# Overview

This project involves creating and querying a database named biochar_db in MySQL. The database is designed to manage biochar sales and includes three main tables: county_lookup, agent_lookup, and biochar_sales. Queries have been written to generate insights on sales performance and revenue metrics categorized by county and agent.

# Project Setup

## Database Creation

Schema: A database named biochar_db was created in MySQL.

Tables: The following tables were created in the database:

county_lookup

agent_lookup

biochar_sales

Data Import:
The data from provided CSV files (County Lookup.csv, Agent Lookup.csv, and Biochar Sales.csv) was imported into the respective tables using MySQL Workbench or CLI.

# Queries and Analysis

 ### Query Requirements:

The goal was to write a query that produces a single table containing the following information:

Number of biochar bags sold per agent

Total revenue expected per agent

Total revenue received per agent

Remaining balance per agent

Additionally, the table should:

Be categorized by county.

Be arranged in descending order based on the number of biochar bags sold.

Include subtotals per county and a grand total.

# Query

SELECT
    c.county_name AS County,
    a.agent_name AS Agent,
    COUNT(b.biochar_id) AS Bags_Sold,
    SUM(b.expected_revenue) AS Total_Revenue_Expected,
    SUM(b.revenue_received) AS Total_Revenue_Received,
    SUM(b.expected_revenue - b.revenue_received) AS Remaining_Balance
FROM
    biochar_sales b
JOIN
    agent_lookup a ON b.agent_id = a.agent_id
JOIN
    county_lookup c ON a.county_id = c.county_id
GROUP BY
    c.county_name, a.agent_name
WITH ROLLUP
ORDER BY
    Bags_Sold DESC;

## Result Table
The result table is contained in the agent_metrics_results.csv file


# Insights from the Results

### Top Performing County:

Machakos leads in sales with 49 bags sold, generating a total expected revenue of 88,200, out of which 79,450 has been received. However, it also has the highest remaining balance of 8,750.

### Agent Performance:

1. Jackson Wambua and Evans Murugu both have no remaining balance, indicating full payments for their sales.

2. Faith Muli has the highest remaining balance (4,350) among agents, highlighting a potential area for follow-up.

### Low Sales Counties:

Uasin Gishu had the lowest activity, with only 1 bag sold and full payment received.

### Overall Revenue Collection:

The project achieved a total revenue of 111,600, with 102,850 collected so far and a remaining balance of 8,750.

# Query and Results:

The SQL queries required to create the schema, set it as the active schema, upload individual files into it, and generate the desired results are saved in the file named project_queries.sql

The result table is stored in the agent_metrics_results.csv file and includes the following metrics:

1.Number of biochar bags sold per agent

2.Total revenue expected per agent

3.Total revenue received per agent

4.Remaining balance per agent

The data is categorized by county and sorted in descending order based on the number of biochar bags sold. Additionally, the table includes subtotals for each county and a final grand total for all data.

The CSV files county_lookup_results.csv, agent_lookup_results.csv, and biochar_sales_results.csv are generated by running individual queries on the tables county_lookup, agent_lookup, and biochar_sales, respectively
